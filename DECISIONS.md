## 2025-12-23: Calculation Logic Fixes

### BIZ-011: Legal Limit Based on Average Consumption

**Context:** Should the 20% over-limit warning use the last fill-up rate or overall average?

**Decision:** Use **average consumption** (total_fuel / total_km × 100) for legal compliance check.

**Reasoning:** Legal compliance is about the overall picture, not a single fill-up. If average is 6.00 and limit is 6.12 (5.1 × 1.2), we're compliant even if one fill-up was higher.

---

### BIZ-010: Retroactive Consumption Rate Application

**Context:** When a fill-up occurs, which trips should use that rate?

**Decision:** Apply the rate **retroactively** to ALL trips since the previous fill-up.

**Example:** If trips A, B, C happen, then fill-up on C gives rate 6.0 → A, B, and C all show 6.0 l/100km.

**Reasoning:** Matches Excel behavior. The rate represents the consumption for that entire period.

---

### BIZ-009: Same-Day Trip Ordering

**Context:** Multiple trips on the same date need deterministic ordering for correct calculations.

**Decision:** Sort by date, then by **odometer** as tiebreaker.

**Reasoning:** Odometer is sequential and represents actual trip order. Using created_at would fail for imported data.

---

### BIZ-008: ODO Auto-Calculation

**Context:** Manual ODO entry is error-prone and redundant since ODO = previous ODO + km driven.

**Decision:** Auto-calculate ODO when km is entered: `ODO = previousODO + km`. User can still manually override.

**Reasoning:** Reduces data entry errors, matches Excel workflow where this was a formula.

---

## 2024-12-23: Business Logic Decisions

### BIZ-007: Fill-up Detection

**Context:** How to distinguish regular trips from fill-ups?

**Decision:** Auto-detect. If liters field is filled → it's a fill-up. No separate entry types.

**Reasoning:** Simpler UX, matches Excel behavior.

---

### BIZ-006: UI Display Order vs Export Order

**Context:** How to show trips in UI vs PDF export?

**Decision:**
- UI: Newest trips on top (reverse chronological) - easier access
- Export: Oldest first (chronological) - matches Excel/legal format

---

### BIZ-005: Route Distance Memory

**Context:** User often drives same routes.

**Decision:** Store origin→destination pairs with their distances. When user selects a known route, auto-fill the km field.

**Reasoning:** Reduces data entry, fewer errors.

---

### BIZ-004: Compensation Trip Suggestions

**Context:** How to help user plan trips to stay within legal margin?

**Decision:**
1. Calculate km needed to bring margin under limit
2. First, try to find existing route from current location matching needed km (±10%)
3. Fallback: Suggest buffer trip with configurable purpose (e.g., "služobná cesta")
4. Target margin: 16-19% (provides safety buffer below 20% limit)

**Reasoning:** Maintaining a buffer below the 20% limit helps ensure compliance even with measurement variations.

---

### BIZ-003: Legal Margin Limit

**Context:** What's the allowed over-consumption?

**Decision:** Max 20% over the vehicle's TP (technical passport) consumption rate.

**Example:** TP = 5.1 l/100km → Max allowed = 6.12 l/100km

---

### BIZ-002: Pouzita Spotreba (Used Consumption Rate)

**Context:** What rate is used to calculate fuel consumption between fill-ups?

**Decision:**
- Initial value: TP rate from vehicle (e.g., 5.1 l/100km)
- After first fill-up: Use the calculated l/100km from that fill-up
- Rate carries forward until next fill-up recalculates it

**Validation:** Matches Excel pattern - each fill-up sets the rate for subsequent trips.

---

### BIZ-001: Consumption Rate Calculation

**Context:** How is l/100km calculated?

**Decision:** On each fill-up: `l/100km = liters_filled / km_since_last_fillup × 100`

**Validation:** Verified against Excel data - formula matches exactly.

---

## 2024-12-23: Architecture Decisions

### ADR-004: Code in English, UI in Slovak

**Context:** User is Slovak, app is for Slovak legal requirements.

**Decision:**
- All code, variables, comments: English
- UI text: Slovak with i18n support for future translation

**Reasoning:**
- English code is industry standard, easier to maintain
- Slovak UI serves the primary user
- i18n-ready for potential future users

---

### ADR-003: Test-Driven Development

**Context:** Need reliable calculations for legal compliance (20% margin rule).

**Decision:** TDD with focus on business logic tests only

**Reasoning:**
- Calculation errors = legal compliance issues
- Tests must be meaningful, not filler
- Focus: consumption calculations, margin checks, compensation suggestions
- Skip: trivial CRUD, UI rendering, getters/setters

---

### ADR-002: SQLite for Local Storage

**Context:** Need to store trips, vehicles, and calculated data.

**Decision:** SQLite (single local file)

**Reasoning:**
- Simple, portable, robust
- Single file easy to backup/move
- Can still export to Excel/CSV for accountants
- No server needed for personal logbook

---

### ADR-001: Desktop App with Tauri + SvelteKit

**Context:** Need to build a vehicle logbook app to replace Excel spreadsheet.

**Options considered:**
1. Electron + React/Vue - Cross-platform, larger bundle (~150MB+)
2. Tauri + SvelteKit - Cross-platform, Rust backend, small bundle (~10-20MB)
3. Python + PyQt - Good for data apps, simpler
4. C# WPF - Windows-only, excellent Excel interop
5. .NET MAUI + Blazor - Cross-platform, C# everywhere

**Decision:** Tauri + SvelteKit

**Reasoning:**
- User said "don't limit ourselves" - open to learning Rust
- Best end-user experience (small, fast, native)
- Svelte is the simplest modern frontend framework
- No need for Excel interop - reimplementing functionality, not integrating
