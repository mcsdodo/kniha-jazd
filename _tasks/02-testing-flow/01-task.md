I fill the excel as follows:
1. input from
2. input to
3. input purpose
4. input km-driven

l/100km, zostatok are calculated automatically.


I need you tu run a test-run to get the values from excel row-by-row, fill in the APP, verify if the calculations match what's in the excel and report back any discrepancies.

1. After every fill-up the "Zostatok" should be equal to what's in vehicle settings fuel tank capacity. This is a calculated value! Not fixed one on fill-up.
2. The l/100km should be calculated correctly.
