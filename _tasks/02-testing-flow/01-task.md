I fill the excel as follows:
1. input from
2. input to
3. input purpose
4. input km-driven


The first entry is always artificial. This app should have it too. It is populated with (only values mentioned, all the rest is '-' and non-editable):
1. purpose: "Prvy zaznam"
2. l/100km: value from TP
3. zostatok: value from TP
4. pouzita spotreba: value from TP
