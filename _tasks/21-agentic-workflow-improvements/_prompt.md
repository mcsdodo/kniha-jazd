# Review prompt

iterate following 4 times: spawn a review agent, look at @_tasks\21-agentic-workflow-improvements\ - review, find gaps, suggest improvements, critically asses. We don't aim for overengineering but for 
polished ai-agentic workflow that just works. After each iteration update _review.md file with iteration, changes made - re-read everything and iterate over. go\
